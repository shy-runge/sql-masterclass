# 👋 Introduction

This free GitHub course is sorted into multiple tutorials which were actually delivered using O'Reilly Katacoda during the live training (which is totally ah-mazing 🤩 )

To avoid any legal issues - all of the SQL live training material is available directly here on GitHub as a companion course which you can learn from at your leisure 👌

You can also see the presentation slides for the live training [here!](https://github.com/datawithdanny/sql-masterclass/tree/main/slides/sql-masterclass-odsc-apac-2021.pdf)
